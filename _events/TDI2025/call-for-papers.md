# Submission Guidelines
We welcome two types of submissions:

- **Original contributions**, including those in preliminary form, which may be considered for inclusion in an open-access post-proceedings volume published by CEUR-WS.org as part of the [CEUR Workshop Proceedings](https://ceur-ws.org/) (indexed by both Scopus and DBLP).

- **Previously published works**, which will not be included in the post-proceedings volume.

Authors must indicate during submission if they wish their paper to be considered for inclusion in the post-proceedings volume.

Submissions must be in English and provided in PDF format, following the CEURART template (1-column layout). Various versions of the template are available for download: [DOCX](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEUR-Template-1col.docx), [ODT](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEUR-Template-1col.odt), and [LaTeX](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-BWHL9t4wvbZw_ThdFzMEltFYxlcpBqp/view). An [Overleaf version](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/hpvjjzhjxzjk) is also available for online use. For LaTeX users, the primary file to edit is `sample-1col.tex`. We encourage users familiar with LaTeX to take advantage of the LaTeX template (either locally or through Overleaf).

Submissions will be classified based on their length as follows:
- **Short papers**: 5-9 pages, including references and appendices.
- **Regular papers**: 10-12 pages, including references and appendices.

All submitted papers will undergo a single-blind review process, so anonymization is **not** required.

Submissions must be made through the [EasyChair conference management system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tdi2025).

Please note that at least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop and present the paper in person.
