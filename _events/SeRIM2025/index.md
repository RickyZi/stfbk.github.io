# Overview
The increasing reliance on identity management systems in key sectors such as healthcare, finance, and public administration has made them a critical component of digital infrastructures. However, as the adoption of identity management solutions expands, it brings forth a growing need to assess and manage the security and risks associated with these systems. Addressing the complex and evolving security and privacy threats to identity management requires not only a deep understanding of potential vulnerabilities but also the development of advanced risk assessment techniques.

This workshop aims at exploring security and risk assessment in identity management systems, by investigating how to evaluate the security posture of identity solutions, assess risks, identify suitable security controls together with privacy enhancing techniques, and ensure compliance with regulations. Through peer-reviewed research papers, live demonstrations of tools, and expert keynote sessions, it will provide a unique venue to discuss the latest trends and innovations to make identity management infrastructures more resilient and supporting fundamental rights and freedom.
