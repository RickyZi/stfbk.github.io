# Submission Guidelines
Submitted manuscripts must present original research that does not substantially overlap with any previously published work or submissions under consideration by other venues.

Submissions must be in English and provided in PDF format, following the IEEE conference proceedings format. They will be categorized into (page limits exclude references and well-marked appendices):
- **Regular Papers**: full-length research papers (up to 10 pages).
- **Short Papers**: research papers presenting preliminary results (up to 6 pages).
- **Tool Papers**: description of tools or practical implementations (up to 4 pages). They will be presented in a Demo Session, where attendees can see live demonstrations of the tools.

All submitted papers will undergo a single-blind review process, so anonymization is **not** required.

Submissions must be made through the [EasyChair conference management system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=serim2025).

Please note that at least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop and present the paper in person.
