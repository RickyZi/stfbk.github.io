METAfora wants to implement new and innovative models of digital identity management and use cases, at the intersection between the progress of European top-down regulations on the subject and the dynamics of the evolving technological framework of the metaverse.

METAfora designs and develops a range of cybersecurity technologies, particularly for digital identity and cryptographic key management. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) makes it possible to manage processes related to digital identity under more secure conditions. In particular, the use of AI increases the productivity of onboarding processes, as it reduces the need for human operator intervention. The project aims at developing a multi-component AI-enhanced architectures based on secure design, verification and execution behavior analysis methodologies.
