The project *Justice, Fundamental Rights and Artificial Intelligence (JuLIA)* is a European Union research project implemented by a Consortium of eleven European partners lead by Universitat Pompeu Fabra.

The project aims at investigating the impact of the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by courts and other public and private institutions, on fundamental rights. JuLIA will analyze the use of AI in decision-making by courts, public administrations, and private agents, such as businesses, healthcare professionals and others, as well as its impact on health and consumer protection rights.

Our contribution is to conduct an in-depth analysis of the technical aspects of ADM (Automated Decision Making) in judicial systems. Our expertise will contribute to developing an interdisciplinary methodology, with a focus on technology.
