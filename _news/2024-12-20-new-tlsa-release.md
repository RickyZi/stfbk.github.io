tag: [release]

TLSAssistant v3.1 is the latest version of our open-source modular framework capable of identifying a wide range of TLS vulnerabilities and assessing compliance with multiple guidelines. Its actionable report can assist the user in correctly and easily fixing their configurations. 
This release introduces a fresh set of analysis modules to detect vulnerabilities in both Android and iOS mobile apps. This is possible thanks to the integration of [SEBASTiAn](https://github.com/talos-security/SEBASTiAn), a cutting-edge security testing tool able to perform static taint analysis using a black-box approach, developed by [Talos](https://talos-sec.com/).

To get more information about the framework, the list of related publications or the involved people, you can head to the [companion page](https://st.fbk.eu/tools/TLSAssistant/).
