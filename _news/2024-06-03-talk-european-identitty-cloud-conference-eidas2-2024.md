The session "**The eIDAS 2.0 Era: Exploring the Security Landscape of Digital Identity Wallets**" has been accepted to the [European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC) 2024](https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5561/2), which will take place in Berlin, Germany, from June 4 to June 7, 2024. 

Here is the abstract:

<blockquote>
<p>In the digital era, the security and privacy of personal and sensitive information have become a critical concern. Digital identity wallets have been introduced as a result of the new European regulation known as eIDAS 2.0. The digital identity wallet offers a practical and secure method for individuals to manage their personal data across various online platforms through a decentralized digital identity management model, without the reliance on centralized identity providers. However, since the model is relatively new, the security and privacy threats are still not fully known; this makes it difficult to prevent data breaches, unauthorized access, and violations of user privacy.</p>
<p>This session will delve into the emerging threats by providing a high-level overview of potential threats applicable to the digital identity wallet, derived from academic literature, technical specifications, and relevant regulations (including eIDAS 2.0).</p>
