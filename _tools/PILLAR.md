### Description

PILLAR (*Privacy risk Identification with LINDDUN and LLM Analysis Report*) is a privacy threat modeling assistant that brings the power of large language models (LLMs) to the established LINDDUN framework. Simply feed PILLAR a natural-language system description and it will transform them into comprehensive threat models with limited input from users. It provides three variants of LINDDUN threat modeling, **SIMPLE, LINDDUN GO (by simulating multi-agent collaboration in a virtual threat modeling workshop), and PRO**.

Please see [**the repository**](https://github.com/stfbk/PILLAR) for more details on **PILLAR**.
